# Silicon

An experimental hardware language and compiler.

Rough roadmap:

- [x] Modules
- [ ] Module instances
- [x] Port declarations
- [x] Let bindings
- [x] Type inference
- [ ] Basic Intermediate Representation
- [ ] Canonicalize IR
- [ ] Functions and calls
- [ ] Parametric functions
- [ ] Unit tests and execution
- [ ] Assertions
- [ ] If statements and loops
- [ ] Clock domain associations for values
- [ ] Tuple types
- [ ] Array types
- [ ] Enum types
- [ ] Struct types
- [ ] Constraints on ports/types in module signature, checked inside/outside
