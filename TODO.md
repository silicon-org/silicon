# TODO

- Codegen does not support `IfExpr` — `if`/`else` expressions fail with "unsupported expression kind" during AST-to-HIR conversion
- SplitPhases does not handle `const { ... }` blocks that contain calls; the ExprOp region isolation check fails because calls and their type ops span different phases (see `test/EndToEnd/const-block.si`)
- Update docs silicon code blocks for `dyn` args, `const`/`dyn` return types, and function-level modifiers once the above bugs are fixed
